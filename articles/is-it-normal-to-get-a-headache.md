### What are some headache symptoms that hint towards a more serious condition?

Headaches are common disorders that many people experience, and many brush it off as something mild and temporary. However, there are some symptoms associated with headaches that hint towards a more serious condition (e.g. infection/ tumours/ neurological illnesses). They include:

If you experience any of these headache symptoms, do get medical care immediately:

- Sudden, new and severe headache
  - Especially if it is after the age of 55, or after a head injury
- Headache that is associated with other neurological symptoms:
  - Dizziness
  - Paralysis/ Difficulty in moving limbs
  - Speech difficulties
  - Sudden loss of balance
  - Seizures
  - Issues with vision (e.g. blurry/ double vision, dark spots)
- Fever/ shortness of breath
- Pain to the point where you wake up at night
- Severe nausea/ vomiting

Any of the above symptoms may suggest more serious neurological conditions, such as stroke, brain aneurysms or brain tumours, which require immediate medical attention.

If you experience any of these headache symptoms, do arrange for an appointment with a doctor or a headache specialist:

- Frequent headaches (more than 3 times a week)
- Headaches that keep worsening
- If you need to take pain relievers all the time for your headaches (or need more than 2-3 doses of medications per week to relieve symptoms)
- Headaches triggered by: physical exertion, coughing, strenuous activity
- Recent change in headache symptoms

While the above symptoms are not necessarily linked to serious medical conditions, do still consult a doctor for a detailed check-up. Treatment may also be given to help relieve your headache symptoms.

### How can the doctor accurately conclude which type of headache I have?

When visiting a doctor, do take note of the following questions:

- When did you start getting headaches?
- Where is the pain located? (which part of the head)
- What symptoms do you have along with a headache?
  - Do your symptoms of headache remain the same?
- How often do you get a headache?
- What are the causes of the headache? (e.g. stress, food, certain actions)
  - Your stress level/ sleep habits/ caffeine drinking habits
- Do you have any family history of headaches?

Knowing the answers to the above questions will allow the doctor to diagnose your headache much more accurately.

The doctor may also perform a series of physical and neurological examinations:

- Measuring your blood pressure
- Taking your temperature
- Testing your vision/ eyesight
- And more

These tests may help to rule out any serious diseases that may also cause headaches.

While special diagnostic tests are often unnecessary, it may sometimes be recommended if the doctor thinks that your headaches are caused by another medical condition.

- Computed tomography (CT) scan/ Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
  - These scans produce images of the brain, helping to confirm if there are any issues with your central nervous system
- Electroencephalogram (EEG) scan
  - A test that detects electrical activity in your brain using small, metal discs (electrodes) attached to your scalp
  - May be necessary if you have fainted during a headache before
  - Helps to diagnose
    - Epilepsy
    - Brain tumours/ damage
    - Stroke
    - Sleep disorder
