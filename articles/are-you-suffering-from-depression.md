Mental well-being is often overlooked when caring for elderly. In many instances, signs and symptoms of deteriorating mental well-being in elderly are **dismissed as a normal part of aging** , which may lead to the **worsening of their mental health** and **development of depression, anxiety and other mental illnesses**.

Mental health is just as important as an elderly&#39;s physical health. In fact, if certain mental illnesses such as depression is left untreated, it can **negatively affect an elderly&#39;s recovery** from serious health conditions such as heart disease.

### How common is depression among elderly in Singapore?

In Singapore, **6% of the elderly population** (65 years old and above) have depression. In 2019, **30.5% of suicide cases** were elderly 60 years old and above.

The following **risk factors** can increase the risk of an elderly having depression:

- Physical illness (e.g. diabetes, heart disease, cancer)
  - Having depression can also increase the risk of physical illnesses
- Disability (e.g. amputation)
- Loneliness
- Lack of physical exercise

**Certain medications** treating other health conditions can also cause depression, especially in elderly **more prone to depression**. These include, but are not limited to:

- Drugs to treat Parkinson&#39;s Disease (e.g. levodopa)
- Hormone drugs
- Anticonvulsants which are medications used to treat seizures (e.g. topiramate)

### How do I know if the elderly in my family have depression?

Symptoms of depression in elderly can be hard to notice since they are often **similar to symptoms of other health conditions** such as dementia. Hence, it is important for family members and friends to **be alert** so that **early intervention and treatment** can be possible.

If **multiple symptoms persist for a 2-week period** or are severe enough to **disrupt relationships or day-to-day activities** , he or she may have clinical depression (major depressive disorder) and may need to seek help.

If an elderly constantly displays some of these symptoms but mildly, please also pay more attention since it could develop into a mental health condition in the future if no action is taken.

### What should I do if an elderly has depression?

Having support from one&#39;s family members is very important for one&#39;s road to recovery. Family members of the elderly should take time off to **get to know about the mental health condition** , such as the treatment options, symptoms and how to provide care for the elderly.

Persuading the elderly to **attend workshops to get to know more about their health condition** is also important.

The following are tips on what family members can do as the role of a caregiver:

1\. Encourage the elderly to lead an active lifestyle

Arranging and attending activities with the elderly can **prevent social isolation** and **engage in regular exercise** , which can help to bring about positive feelings. Some activities can include yoga or Taichi.

2\. Having a support system

Visiting and spending time with the elderly regularly can help to build a support system within the family. This can **encourage the elderly to confide** in the family members about their concerns and emotions without being judged, which can help the elderly to **feel less lonely and more supported**.

3\. Helping the elderly to find a sense of purpose

**Entrusting the elderly with a responsibility** such as watering plants or doing simple chores can provide the elderly with a **sense of purpose** and **avoid negative emotions** such as worthlessness.

**Helping the elderly to find a hobby** and participating in it together can also provide the elderly with a way to occupy their time. Setting and working towards goals provides a **sense of accomplishment**. **Social activities** such as chess or dance classes for seniors can also **encourage social interaction**.

4\. Encourage the elderly to seek professional help

While support from the family is important, seeking professional help for treatment is also important in the road to recovery. **Having open discussions about the topic** and **gently helping the elderly come to terms with their health condition** is the first step to encouraging them to seek treatment.

Social stigmas may cause the elderly to be reluctant to seek help, hence it is important that the caregivers are **empathetic and patient**.

5\. Consider hiring professional caregivers

Being a caregiver has a lot of roles and responsibilities which the family members may not be able to take up. Professional caregivers are trained in **helping the elderly in their daily activities** and **identifying what the elderly may need**. Hence, they may be able to **devote more attention** and **time** to caring for the elderly.

### What are some possible treatment options?

A holistic approach is recommended for treatment of depression.

#### Lifestyle change

Family members should help the elderly and encourage them to:

- Eat healthily (e.g. prepare healthy meals for them to heat up easily)
- Exercise regularly (e.g. schedule and participate in physical activities with them)

Elderly **may not take the initiative** to make changes in their lifestyle, due to loss of appetite and other symptoms of depression, hence it is important for the caregiver and the family to **play an active role** in helping them to recover.
