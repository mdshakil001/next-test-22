## Diagnosis and Test

### General flow of diagnosis:

In order to determine whether you really have Erectile dysfunction (ED), the doctor will have to perform some tests. Further, these tests can help your doctor to decide the most suitable treatment options for you, and detect any underlying conditions that may be causing your ED.

**For normal people (who don&#39;t have chronic health conditions, doctors do not suspect any underlying health conditions)**

A doctor can diagnose your ED and recommend suitable treatment just through a **physical exam** and **answering some questions about your lifestyle.**

### Physical exam

A physical exam checks your entire physical health. These tests are also not painful.
