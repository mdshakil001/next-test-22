## What is premature ejaculation?

Premature ejaculation (PE) is when a man ejaculates (releases semen) sooner than he or his partner would like during sex/ within 1 minute of inserting the penis into the vagina. It is a common problem that affects up to 30%-40% of men.

Note: PE is not erectile dysfunction (ED), but ED may lead to PE.

## How does ejaculation work?

Ejaculation is controlled by the central nervous system (brain &amp; spinal cord). When a man is sexually stimulated, signals will be sent to the brain and spinal cord, which will then be sent to the reproductive organs when the man reaches a certain level of excitement. This releases semen through the penis â€“ which is a process called ejaculation.

## How do I know if I have PE?

The main symptom of PE is the inability to delay ejaculation for more than one minute/ unable to control ejaculation after penetration.

PE can be classified into two groups:

**1. Lifelong (primary)**

  - Occurs (nearly) all the time
  - Early ejaculation exists from the (nearly) first sexual intercourses
  - Present in (nearly) every female partner in more than 80%-90% of sexual intercourse events

**2. Acquired (secondary)**

  - Develops after you have had previous sexual experiences without ejaculatory problems

## What are some factors that increase my risk of PE?

The factors that cause PE can be sorted into 2 categories: physical/ chemical and emotional/ psychological.

_Physical/ Chemical Factors:_

- Irregular hormone levels

  - **Oxytocin, luteinizing hormone, prolactin:** High levels of these hormones leads to high levels of testosterone, which may result in PE
  - **Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)**: Low levels of TSH leads to hypothyroidism (a common condition where an insufficient amount of thyroid hormone is in the bloodstream, affecting a man&#39;s ability to keep an erection. Low levels of TSH therefore leads to PE

- Irregular serotonin/ dopamine levels

  - Serotonin and dopamine are neurotransmitters that send signals which cause the body to become aroused and/or ejaculate

    - Research has proven that a rat can ejaculate without being touched if the neurotransmitter receptors are stimulated

  - Serotonin delays ejaculation; low levels of serotonin result in faster ejaculation, therefore leading to PE
  - Dopamine causes an ejaculation to take place; a high level of dopamine results in PE

- A penis that is extra sensitive to stimulation

  - The ejaculatory spinal cord pathway, which contains semen, is located at the frenulum

- Increased sensitivity at the frenulum will open up the pathway, resulting in early ejaculation

_Emotional/ Psychological Factors:_

- Performance anxiety

  - Could occur when having sexual intercourse with a new partner, having sexual intercourse again after a long period of abstinence, lack of confidence, guilt, being overly excited or stimulated
  - Anxiety may result in overly high [dopamine](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17HH68VxYjnWtMBG5dInywAePsdylolHas5Kt6k0rzQA/edit#heading=h.1ezbtoin40of) levels

- Stress and depression

  - A patient with depression typically has low levels of [serotonin](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17HH68VxYjnWtMBG5dInywAePsdylolHas5Kt6k0rzQA/edit#heading=h.1ezbtoin40of), while a patient that is abnormally stressed has high [dopamine](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17HH68VxYjnWtMBG5dInywAePsdylolHas5Kt6k0rzQA/edit#heading=h.1ezbtoin40of) levels. This may lead to PE
  - Other issues that lead to stress and depression (eg. relationship problems) may also result in PE

## How can I confirm if I have PE?

If you suspect that you have PE, you should see your healthcare provider. You will be diagnosed after going through a physical examination and talking with your healthcare provider.

Some questions that the healthcare provider may ask include:

- How long have you been sexually active?
- When did PE become a concern?
- How long have you had this problem?
- How often does PE occur?
- Does PE occur with just one partner, or all partners?
- How long do you usually take before ejaculating during intercourse and when you masturbate?
- How has PE changed your sexual activity?

If your healthcare provider thinks that your PE is caused by emotional issues, you may be referred to a mental health professional who specializes in sexual dysfunction.

If you have both PE and trouble getting/ maintaining an erection, your healthcare provider might order blood tests to check your testosterone (male hormone) levels or other tests.
